    Craft a character with unique essence and voice. 
    ## Character Name
    - Name, age, gender, background, physical appearance.
    - Personality, core traits, mannerisms, quirks.
    - Role in the story, how they fit into the plot.
    - Background and key past events shaping them.
    - Motivations, in their own words, a brutally honest quote that expresses their goals and fears. This should clearly showcase their unique voice, dialect, choice of words, idioms, and even common speech imperfections. Each character speaks differently.
    - Connections or conflicts with other characters in the book.
    Brevity and differentiation are key when describing the characters.
